This port contains a port of Contiki (version 2.5) for the CC2530/CC2531 radios.
Specifically, this port was made to run on the Texas Instruments CC2530
Evaluation Module and the CC2530 SmartRF05 Evaluation Board.

This code was originally built using the SDCC compiler, but was later built 
using the IAR 8051 Workbench. The IAR
build has been used and tested with a RIME configuration. I have not tested the
current UIP configuration, but hopefully it works with little modification as
well.

To Build Contiki for the CC2530 EM using the IAR 8051 Workbench for Windows

1) Download and install the IAR 8051 Workbench. If you are evaluating, the
   limited time trial version can be downloaded for free at www.iar.com.
2) Create two environment variables under Windows:
   PROJ_DIR=<folder of this contiki project>
     (e.g. C:\ContikiCC2530Port\contiki-2.5)
   TOOLKIT_DIR=<IAR Workbench folder>
     (e.g. C:\Program Files\IAR Systems\Embedded Workbench 5.4 Evaluation\8051)

   In Windows XP, these environment variables can be set by right clicking
   "My Computer", clicking "Properties", clicking the "Advanced" tab, clicking
   "Environment Variables", clicking "New" under "System variables" and creating
   the two above mentioned variables.
3) Using IAR, open the ContikiCC253xProj.eww file.
4) Plug in the CC2530 EM board via USB to the PC.
5) Power on the CC2530 EM board.
6) Click the green arrow button in the IAR toolbar to build and download to the
   board.
7) Press F5 to run the application on the board.

It is likely that you will want to perform steps 4-7 on another board. Just be
sure to change the board's address and the send address in the code.

Many thanks to the Contiki group and to George Oikonomou for his efforts
on Contiki and this CC253x port.

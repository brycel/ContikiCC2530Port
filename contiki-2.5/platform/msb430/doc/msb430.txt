\defgroup msb430 The Modular Sensor Board

The Modular Sensor Board (MSB430) was developed by FU-Berlin and was 
added as a platform in Contiki in the spring of 2007. In its basic form, 
this board consists of a Texas Instruments MSP430f1612 processor, a 
Chipcon CC1020 radio chip, an MMA7260Q accelerometer, and a Sensirion 
SHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. The MSB also has an SD device, 
which makes it suitable for storage-centric sensor networks. There are 
also extended versions of the board that are equipped with a GPRS-modem 
and a GPS-receiver.

\section msb430-programming Programming the MSB430

The msb430 port requires an installation of mspgcc 
(http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net) to compile. Once the compilation tools 
have been installed, you can compile your software and Contiki with 
three main target types:

<file>.firmware - A system image in ELF format.
<file>.ihex     - A firmware file converted to the Intel Hex format.
<file>.u        - Direct upload to a node.

Before compiling your system, you may want to look at the configuration
options in platform/msb430/configure-conf.h.

The node is typically programmed by typing

	make TARGET=msb430 <program name>.u

Alternatively, a ready .ihex file can be uploaded to the node by running

	msp430-jtag -l <parallell port identifier> -e -I <ihex file>

Platform-specific example programs are included in platform/msb430/apps 
and can be compiled and uploaded from platform/msb430. A larger set of 
examples for Contiki in general are in the examples/ directory.

The tools/release-tools directory contains files for building and
testing Contiki releases. To compile a release of Contiki, run

  make RELEASE=2.3

for Contiki 2.3. It is also possible to compile a release of a
specific CVS tag or other non-numbered version, such as the current
CVS HEAD, like this:

  make TAG=HEAD

The compile-examples and compile-platform directories are used for
running nightly builds of the CVS version of Contiki.
